Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language first released in 1991. It was created by Guido van Rossum and was designed to be easy to understand and easy to read, with a syntax that emphasizes code readability. Python is a popular language for general-purpose programming, web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. One of the main advantages of Python is its large standard library, which provides a wide range of prebuilt functions and modules that can be used directly in your programs. Python is also known for its simplicity, ease of use and flexibility. It is open-source, free to use and is supported by a large community of developers.
